Brave New OARC
is a merge of both OARC and Brave New World mods

OARC: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/oarc-mod
Brave New World: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/brave-new-world

Since Brave New World is ideally single player and OARC is the best multiplayer mod that enables single players to build their own bases but share with other players on the same team, I decided to combine the two mods.

I started with OARC 1.0.1 and BNW 4.11

Brave New Oarc enables you to play Brave New World and OARC together, and best of all - with other players.  I've made alot of changes,
