Brave New OARC
is a merge of both OARC and Brave New World mods

OARC: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/oarc-mod
Brave New World: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/brave-new-world

Since Brave New World is ideally single player and OARC is the best multiplayer mod that enables single players to build their own bases but share with other players on the same team, I decided to combine the two mods.

I started with OARC 1.0.1 and BNW 4.11

This does not turn on any special features.

Known issues:
Reset player, done by moderator in the game will remove the players base, reset him to 0,0 spawn, but respawning to a new location is not done correctly. 
Bots will explode if too far from a charge for too long - well that's a feature, upto the point the 40 of them do it.
