6/24/2023 - 4.2.07
bug fixes due to large maps running into issues with spawning players into unsafe areas - fixed.
bug fix - occasionally spawning a player would cause them to crash the game - fixed.
added the number of biters in attack swarm
fixed transport drones exploding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5/09/2023 - 4.2.06
Added a setting for the world size, Small, Normal, Large. Small is half of normal, Large is double of Normal.
Increased the max number of silos to 24.
Modified the drop down for restart for admins to prompt with their name for when they quickly want to respawn.
Moved the water slot for no moat spawns to top left - on the edge of the tree line.
Removed duplicate swarm pings.
Performance enhancement to not check swarms every tick, perform once per second only when there are swarms incoming
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5/04/2023 - 4.2.05
Bug Fix
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5/02/2023 - 4.2.04
Moved Buddy spawn 2.5 chunksize further apart. previously they were 5 chunksize, so now 7.5.
The buddy spawn was overlapping logistics areas, which is ok if you want the other player to control
your bots in that area. But it should be further apart.

Bug Fixes:
Fixed on first launch the game would crash.
Fixed where the swam notification could crash due to some state the swarm is in that is not fully identified in the group entity.
Fixed where a drop occurs on some unknown surface - this one has me stumped, but it won't break now. You'll see a notification
to only the player that the bug was initiated from to tell me to look at logs. I should probably broadcast it, but I'll be 
monitoring all logs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/30/2023 - 4.2.03
Added an option to enable a swarm to be tagged via a ping/gps statement for each player. Clicking the ping
follows the biter swarm approaching the base. Clicking that ping after the swarm is dead will show where they 
grouped for the attack - which is useful to know where they came from.
Turning on/off this option default is settable by the host, but currently it is settable by each player
within the game via the top left settings and is a per-player setting.
Each player will only see their pings, showing incoming swarms, and only active swarms that are moving towards your base.
I haven't tested this in buddy mode, but buddies should see swarms intended for your/their bases.

Hopefully - finally fixed the Silo not being able to be researched bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/24/2023 - 4.2.02
-bug introduced into 4.2.01 - I locked the recipe and technology for productivity-module-3 behind a rocket launch. Well you
 couldn't research a silo without proctivity-module-3's !  Fixed
-added ability for each player to restart themselves at any time - no warning that they are going to lose their base - yet, be careful
 I'll put a limit to the number of restarts. Note the 15 minute timer starts from the time you initially start, so 15 minutes of restarts and you may be stuck with the last base
 I will try to warn you with the number of restarts you have left - for now there is no limit
-moved the pump for easy start where you get a free boiler and two pumps, and chest to not run out of power too early. 
 The pump was close to walls and could mistakenly be removed by removing the walls.
-admins can remove offline players
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/10/2023 - 4.2.01
Fixed collision box of Main Mega Roboport - so you can place items directly next to it
Removed excessive logging, which should improve performance
Changed spacing of in base oil deposits so that one storage tank will fit between two dericks with no space
Moat water is 8 tiles, increased to 12. The spitter range is 15, at an angle this may keep spitters from attacking items(pumps),
in the base. This normally occurs when there is a moat bridge.

I noticed power on the Mega Roboport - can drop to zero very rapidly when alot of bots are charging. Quadrupling:
input flow limit, buffer capacity & energy_usage. The MegaRoboport is fully charged at the start of the game, a normal roboport
Since your bots will fly to your team mates base to charge - if your power goes to zero, I added a boiler and steam engine, as an option
pickable at start of the map, by the map host. This will power bots all night and is removeable. BUT if you remove the water pump - you can not place it 
again - it is a waterless waterpump.

Increased bot storage from 8 slots to 10 in the Mega Roboport.
Leaving player name in their base after the Welcome disappears.
Made it configurable by the game host to enable the player to choose whether there is a moat bridge, or to make them play via the choice of the host.
I add three dots of oil at a random location outside of main base. It is spawned with a random amount of richness. I have increased the minimum richness.
Slightly risky here - I tested but didn't take the time for a full test - I added auto removal of miners after they deplete the resource.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/1/2023 - 4.2.00
Bug fixes - some also pushed back into Oarc and BNW.
Deletion of Vehicles spider/tank/jeep outside of pollution zone fixed
Crash in dropItems fixed
Crash on launch of rocket - fixed
Less logging - save on lag
Regrowth works - leave it ON in the default config.lua file, no other regrowth mods needed
Added option for 250/500 of logistic/construction bots at the start of a map
Moved Speed Module 3 and Production Module 3 into locked entities, awaiting a missile launch. 
I was told it was confusing to see that a L3 module was available, but was not selectable, one user thought this was a bug. 
Now it will unlock and you'll have to research to obtain these modules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/26/2023 4.1.9
Modifying graphics - so the main roboport looks different and is larger.
Expanded main roboport to have 16 charge slots.
Logistics network and construction radius doubled.
Icon fixed, removing confusion over duplicate Roboport icons.
Previously selecting the "other" roboport icon that looked the same placed a roboport, 
but if you used this icon for logistics it didn't limit roboports, because it 
was actually roboport-main.  Main area changed again. This is now visible as an icon if 
for example you selected it from the group of entities in the game for the toolbar. 
But you can not place it or copy it.
Main Roboport has 16 robots charging at no extra cost other than the spike that occurs when 16 bots charge.

I've decided that not locking Spidertron until a missile is launched is going to add to more fun. You NEED a spidertron to setup remote bases, disconnected from your main base. 
You may need a spidertron if you don't want to kreep roboports to the silo. You can bring construction bots, deploy and setup a train line without a logistics line using Spidertron.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/21/2023 - 4.1.8
Bug fix. This only impacted game play if you wanted to see the contents of the yellow logistic storage chests at center, or if you deleted them. There is actually an invisible chest over the normal chest there. This is the only fix for 4.1.8

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/19/2023 - 4.1.7
Well I broke the bots. Their power consumption was way too high because I reversed their energy use per tick and their energy use per move. Hell the bots were coming out of the roboport to recharge. 
Glad none had heart attacks. FIXED !

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/19/2023 - 4.1.6
Modified starting area, upgraded starting power from 50Mj to 90Mj and power from 720kW to 1.4MW, Fully charged. Also placed a blue chest with requests for robots.
The bots will go into chests if you move the roboports.

No more special bots. The problem was that when you choose "fast bots" and you finally get to making bots, you're disappointed at how slow they are. They become a major negative
towards fun game play.

We now have a end game scenario - previously if one person's main roboport died, every one died.  The changes: Biters HATE your main roboport and if they get near it, 
they will aggressively attack it, but they are passive to all other roboports.
If the main one dies, you immediately get thrown back to 0,0 location and are able to restart, rejoin a force. No one else is impacted.

Fixed RESTART player so the menu comes up once they go back to 0,0.

Many settings added to the "Mod settings" screen:
	- number of Silo's' - 1..12
	- Bots energy use, normal, increase energy storage, increase range, increase movement, increase all
		Bots consume energy, Fast bots consume more energy. Energy is VERY important in this scenario.
		Increase storage, increases their max storage from 1.5MJ to 3MJ
		Increase range, decreases their consumption per tick
		Increase movement, decreases their consumption while moving
	- Number of starting bots added to your mod settings - you choices: 10/5, 50/25, 100/50, 200/100 for construction/logistic bots
	  The max bots in starter roboport are 350, so I think these are good options.  If you choose 10/5 I recommend also clicking on the resistance values to make them "nearly" indestructible.
	- Bot speed in km/h.  10-400.  Note that the default game starts at 12.9 km/h. So choose 13 if you want to go close to default. Increases in research will speed them up further.
	- Bridge moat - if you have a moat, do you want biters to access your players?
	- anti-grief. This basically turns off the ability for someone to delete anything in your base via map view.
	- TTL for ghost images - default is 30 minutes, options, 10, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 or use config.lua to define
	- Item and Energy Sharing - chests and accumulators that enable you to share items and power with EVERYONE.
	- Base shape - Circle or Octagon
	- Resitances to make you bots near indestructible !

Verified - buddy spawn to kick all players associated with that base

1/15/2023 - 4.1.5
Welcome message disappears but player name remains
Oil patch slight move to enable roboport to fit between it.
Fixed reset player - but player has to be offline for it to work properly
Previously if one player lost their starting roboport it ended the game. Now it will display that
you lost but enables you to continue playing.  I may change this to immediately remove and clean up 
player that died and not hastle other players with the lose message.
Options settable by host:
	added moat bridge option in gui MOD interface
	added four different resistances in MOD interface for fire, spitter, explosion and physical damage to bots
	added support for turning anti-griefing on/off. This disables delete in map view and sets a time limit on ghost items.
	moved oil to make room for roboport between it
	offer chest sharing and energy share
	Number of silos

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/8/2023 - 4.1.4
More work finding bots that explode, removed excessive logging. Fixed exploding bots.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/7/2023 - 4.1.3
12/27/2022
Modified the start state to be 1x multiplier for research. Most people will just play scenario from the mod, not start a server, use the technology_price_multiplier in map-settings.json if running from a server.
I may not have upgraded the github before posting to factorio mod site, so this is updated, in both location.

12/29/2022
Increased richness of three oil spots outside main, with randomness on how rich

1/05/2023
Modified bots so they are indestructible. This needs some work since I don't mind if they die,
I just don't want them randomly exploding because you are working them too hard. 
Slowing them down to a crawl and letting them die to biters if misused is fine,
but just exploding for some unknown cause is bull.

1/07/2023 - Anti-grief turned on by default (config.lua)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/26/2022 4.1.2
Fixed issue with moving player on reset and second player not being moved to new location on start
Fixed issue where sometimes the base was not cleaned up when a player is reset of leaves

Adding - closer/further biters - based on Starting Area Size
Adding - a text message on ground to tell player to get power
