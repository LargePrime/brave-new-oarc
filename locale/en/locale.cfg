[mod-setting-description]
bno-num-starting-bots=Number of Construction/Logistics bots to start
bno-starting-bots_speed=Set speed of bots, and know that fast bots can impact your game lag
bno-bots_energy=Robots use energy this impacts their storage, energy per move, and energy per tick. Increase enables them to move longer without a charge. Faster bots consume energy faster.
bno-moat-bridge=If enabled you will start with a bridge to you main, allowing biters to access via upto two entrances?
bno-bots-resistance-acid=Acid resistance will make your robots able to withstand attacks from spiters without taking damage
bno-bots-resistance-fire=fire resistance will make your robots able to withstand flame throwers while repairing walls
bno-bots-resistance-explosion=explosion resistance will make your robots able to withstand grenades and other explosions near them
bno-bots-resistance-physical=physical resistance will make your robots able to withstand biters attacking them
bno-anti-grief=enabling anti-grief disables delete in map view and enables the time limit on ghost placement
bno-anti-grief-ghost-TTL=Minutes that ghost images will remain before being deleted
bno-chest-sharing=Enable Item and Energy Sharing system
bno-spawn-base-shape-circle=Shape of base - Octagon or Circle or for Map-gen folks, use what is in config.lua
bno-main-area-design-boiler-n-steam-engines=New players may need power to last the night, this option enables coal/wood to power the base for additional 1800 Watts
bno-number-of-silos=Number of distant silos that are used by teams
bno-test=testing
